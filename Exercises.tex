\addcontentsline{toc}{subsection}{VirtualBox Appliance}
\subsection*{VirtualBox Appliance}
Exercise instructions are included in this document. All software and
examples are available on the VirtualBox appliance distributed during
class. To install the VirtualBox appliance:
\begin{enumerate}
  \item Copy the \textbf{Ubuntu.ova} from the distributed USB drive to
    your hard disk.
  \item Also, copy the VirtualBox installer for your operating system
    from the USB drive to your hard disk.
  \item Execute the VirtualBox installer to install the software.
  \item Double-click on the \textbf{Ubuntu.ova}. This will begin the
    VM import process.
\end{enumerate}

\addcontentsline{toc}{subsection}{Virtual Machine Manifest}
\subsection*{Virtual Machine Manifest}
The VirtualBox appliance is an Ubuntu Linux distribution. Within it is
the software we will use for this class:
\begin{description}
  \item [Eclipse Indigo] the IDE used for class. Includes Subclipse,
    the m2eclipse plugin, and pre-installed projects with examples.
  \item [Oracle jrockit JVM] the JVM used for executing/testing
    examples.
  \item [soapUI] Utility for debugging soap communication
  \item [Maven 3] used to build Rice applications, run tests, and
    start the Tomcat6 application
  \item [OpenLDAP slapd] the OpenLDAP project LDAP server used for the
    LDAP integration examples.
  \item [ldap-utils] the OpenLDAP project utilities for working with
    Directory Services.
  \item [Oracle MySQL Database Server] where the Rice applications
    will store persistent information.
\end{description}

\subsubsection*{Credentials}
\begin{description}
\item [User Account] is \textbf{rice} with the password
  \textbf{rice}. This is used to unlock the VM after it has suspended,
  gone to sleep, or locked. The password is also required for
  executing commands as \textbf{root} which may on occassion be
  required. The user account home directory is located at
  \textbf{/home/rice} and will frequently be referred to during the training.
\item [Database Account] uses the jdbc connection string
  \textbf{jdbc:mysql://localhost:3306/kuldemo} and the
  username/password \textbf{kuldemo}/\textbf{kuldemo}. These are the
  default credentials and database connection information as defined
  in kul-cfg-dbs.
\end{description}

\subsubsection*{Structure}
The Eclipse workspace is located at \textbf{/home/rice/workspace}. In
it are three projects used during the training: \textbf{cas},
\textbf{rice-src}, and \textbf{trnapp}.

Other examples and exercises from the \textbf{Basic Kuali Rice
  Training} can be found in \textbf{/home/rice/Aug2011}. You may feel
free to go through these as well at your leisure.
